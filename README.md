Java skills demonstration

DATE 2023 January, 22 7:39pm
My first personal Java project. It's an initial program to solidify my understanding roughly one week after beginning to learn Java. 

It demonstrates a basic understanding of the following:

- Importing libraries and using associated methods.
- Showing a basic understanding of how to comment clearly.
- Using scanners.
- Utilizing basic exception handling techniques.
- Storing user input in an ArrayList and iterating through it. 
- Declaring multiple types of variables.
- Using nested loops. (While & For)
- Creating a clean terminal for the user to work with.
- Performing basic math calculations.
- Input validation.

After completing this, my goal will be to continue the education journey into advanced concepts. Most notably, the core object-oriented aspects of Java.
